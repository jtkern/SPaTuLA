# SPaTuLA
üó∫Ô∏è We are influenced by our surroundings at the cellular level. Spatial RNA-seq data provides detailed insight into how cell-cell signaling and environmental cues influence gene expression and cell phenotype in disease and development. 

üëâ We developed SPaTuLa, a novel spatial RNA-seq simulator that models cell-cell communication to generate synthetic, biologically-inspired spatial gene expression patterns. 

Key features:
1. Hybrid agent-based and reaction-diffusion model 
2. SymSim integration to simulate gene expression
3. User-friendly RShiny interface 

‚ö°Ô∏è The performance of SPaTuLA was evaluated on (1) a synthetic toggle switch circuit and (2) a hypothesized 3-cell circuit driving spatial organization of the endometrium. In the future, we hope to expand our simulator capabilities to more closely capture signaling interactions and recapitulate biological patterns.
